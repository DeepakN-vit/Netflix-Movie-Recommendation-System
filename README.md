# Netflix-Movie-Recommendation-System
Implemented a Netflix movie recommendation system leveraging the Apriori algorithm on a dataset obtained from Netflix. The project commenced with the preprocessing of transactional data, where each transaction represented a user's interaction with movies. Utilizing Pandas and NumPy, the dataset was organized to facilitate the identification of frequent itemsets.

Next, the Apriori algorithm was applied to mine association rules from the dataset. This involved determining the support, confidence, and lift of each rule to assess its significance in recommending movies to users. The generated rules were then used to provide personalized movie recommendations based on users' historical viewing patterns.

The recommendation system was designed to enhance user engagement and satisfaction by suggesting relevant movies tailored to individual preferences. Through the integration of data manipulation techniques, visualization tools such as Matplotlib, and the implementation of the Apriori algorithm, the project aimed to deliver an intuitive and effective movie recommendation experience for Netflix users.
